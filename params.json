  "body": "### Sys-update, tools of the past for the future\r\nGNU/Linux distributions can unfortunately be unfriendly to the uninitiated, but we are the initiated. Sys-update uses simple package manager tools to update a subset of popular and widely used GNU/Linux distributions to assist in the transition for newcomers. As new comers may attempt to avoid the loving embrace of the terminal and the several shells available to GNU/Linux users, Sys-update is prepared as a GUI tool. For those of us who love the terminal, checkout pyupdate for a cli version.\r\n\r\n### Tk under the hood through Python 3\r\nSys-update is crafted with tkinter through Python 3, a widely available programming language. Tkinter is popular for making GUI tools, as it allows the native window manager to create and the applications to keep the software as native looking as possible.\r\n\r\n### Available Distributions\r\nSys-update covers a large sweep of distributions by using the package manager native to the parent distribution. In today's world, there is a large gene-pool of GNU/Linux distributions, but the majority of popular distributions are derived from a few distributions: Arch, RHEL, and Debian. In theory, any distribution based off of these that use the parents package manager will be able to be successfully updated using Sys-update. As an added bonus, Solus, an independent built from scratch distribution, can be updated using Sys-update as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSys-update was collaboratively crafted for a System analysis and Design class by a team of 3. This is Team 8, consisting of @JakeBonek, Andrew, and @CodyKank\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nAs this project focused more on the design of the system and other documents not seen here, the software product may be faulty and buggy. There are a few known bugs right now that will for the most part stay frozen in time.\r\n",
